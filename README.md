This is a pretty simple project that uses Node, Express, Json-server, and GraphQL to create a playground for learning GraphQL. It's a simple API that allows you to create, read, update, and delete users, belonging to a company. It also does not allows you to create, read, update, and delete companies.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow the following steps 
* Clone the repo
* run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
* Then run `npm run database` to start the json-server.
* Then run `npm run start` to start the service.
* You can then navigate to `http://localhost:4000/graphql` to see the GraphQL playground.
